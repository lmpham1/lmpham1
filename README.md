# Le Minh Pham

## Hello, my name is Minh 

The 'h' is not silent, but you can pretend it is. Vietnamese is a weird language.  
Anyways, I'm a software developer based in Toronto, Canada.

## (un)Exciting stuff I've worked on
- Fiddled with an issue of [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/6139) :sauropod:
- Created a few chatbots for Discord and Messenger â€” because I have no IRL friends :robot:
- Played around with React.js apps (mostly just to impress my non-tech friends) :zap:
- Cooked up random and silly tools :wrench: (because why not?)
- (Attempted to) learn K-pop dance choreos :dancer:

My goal is to find a job fulfilling enough that I can stop googling up "how to start a content-creating career".
